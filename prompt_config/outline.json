this is for you, Priscilla, so don't hesitate to interrupt me and ask questions,\nokay?\nOr if there's anything else that you want to see, then let me know for sure.\nThat's good.\nAll right, so I have logged into the Whits training instance for Florida.\nSo as an admin, one of the things that you will probably be responsible for, especially\nat the state level is setting up new agencies and facilities as they come online.\nSo basically what that means is, say a provider comes to the state and they say that they\nwant to do services, contracts get completed and all that kind of good stuff.\nNot quite sure of all the minutia that happens in the background, but you had that contract\nbetween the state and the provider that says the provider is going to provide certain\nservices and that sort of thing.\nAnd that all gets signed in everything.\nIf those providers are going to be using Whits to manage their caseload, manage your clients,\nthat sort of thing, then they will need to have an agency and facilities created for them\nin Whits.\nAll of that for you, it's going to be here on agency from the left navigation menu, this\nagency tile.\nWhen you click on it, it will automatically take you to what's called the agency list.\nAnd you will see a list of all the agencies that have already been created in Whits for\nyour state so far.\nAnd then from there you can just click add new agency record to create a new record.\nYou can also go into, oh, there's Crystal.\nYou can also go into the agency's and existing agencies profile by hovering over the vertical\nellipsis and then clicking review.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nHey, Crystal, how's it going?\nGood.\nHow are you?\nDoing pretty good.\nA little chilly here, but we had a little.\nOh, yeah.\nOh, where are you at?\nKansas City.\nOh gosh.\nYeah, it's cold here, but I'm sure you are much colder.\nAnd honestly, it's very blue skies, so it doesn't feel as cold as it has been, but\nyeah.\nBut so, Priscilla and I went ahead and got started since this is mainly just for her.\nBut if you think of anything that I need to cover with her, please feel free to jump\nin and let us know.\nYeah.\nHow long do you think that you would be talking to her and I'm going to tell you why I'm\nasking?\nI'm going through the administrative power point because I really tried to have this done\nbefore right now so that we could talk about scheduling that before we got done today.\nSo I was going to jump off and then jump back on or I guess I could just have Priscilla\ncall me when you guys are done too.\nYeah.\nI mean, I've, it's blocked.\nThey blocked off two hours.\nOkay.\nOh, Priscilla, do you want to give me a call then through teams when you guys are done?\nAnd then I will, yeah, because it shouldn't take me very long to go through this.\nI'm thinking they just didn't understand what they should be doing because now I'm having\nto take screenshots and give instructions step by step on things that they should know\nhow to do.\nAnd they would have if they had paid attention during your training.\nOh, no.\nSo yeah.\nThat training did get recorded.\nDid you guys still have a copy of that that you can send them as well?\nNo, I don't know that I receive any, I may have received the recording, but is it on\nthe site, isn't it?\nThe share site where everything is located.\nI'd have to go take a look and see where we put it.\nIt might be on the share point.\nI know that's typically where we, you look, that is typically where we upload it because\notherwise if it stays in my team's team's all flag it for deletion after about 30 days\nor something like that.\nIt's not important right now.\nYou go ahead and focus on this with Priscilla and we can, we can talk about that after, after\nthis so you guys can just stay on, stay on task and I'm not disrupting.\nOkay, no worries.\nWhat you're doing.\nAll right.\nWell, I will talk to you guys in just a little bit then.\nAre you doing it?\nI'm sorry, Chris.\nChris, were you dropping?\nYeah, they're going to call me when they get done because I'm going through the PowerPoint\nso that we can get something scheduled as soon as before we get off here today and we\nfeel comfortable with what we're going to do moving forward.\nOkay, all righty.\nBye.\nTalk to you later.\nBye.\nOkay.\nBye.\nHello, Ann.\nHi there.\nHow's it going?\nIt's going okay.\nI, I, no Priscilla already knows this and Crystal did.\nI'm going to just listen in for the first hour and then I have to go to another thing but\njust wanted to be present in case you needed me.\nAbsolutely.\nThank you.\nSorry for that Priscilla.\nAll right, so like I said, here on the agency list, if you wanted to access an agency's\nprofile, you just hover over the vertical ellipsis and then click review and that will take\nyou into an existing agency's profile.\nBut if you need to create a new agency record, then you will just click this add new agency\nrecord button.\nSo we'll just go ahead and do that now.\nThis is a training instance.\nSo I'll just create a pretend agency tower.\nSo what you'll do is on the agency profile, you'll have those required fields that you're\nprobably familiar with seeing.\nSo the, the fields with that orange bar to the left of it.\nAt the very minimum, those fields have to be completed.\nThese other fields only need to be completed as, you know, you guys just determine that\nyou want to capture that information basically.\nThe agency name and the display name typically are the same.\nThe only instance where it's not the same is if the agency name is really long because\nonly about the first, I think 12 to 16 characters will show up in the display name field.\nSo like if your agency name is really long, then whenever you go down to the display\nname, you'll find that you can't type out the entire thing.\nSo the display name is what you're going to see in widths like whenever you're looking\nat drop down menus and that sort of thing.\nSo if your entire name for that agency doesn't fit in the display name, truncate it so\nthat whenever you do see it and like say your drop down menus and stuff, you see it\nand you're like, oh, yeah, no one agency that is.\nRight.\nOkay.\nAgency type.\nYou'll choose whichever agency, what type of agency that it is for, that, you know, as\nfar as like the type of services that they're providing that sort of thing.\nI believe in most cases though, it's going to be single state agency.\nAlthough I've never noticed this before and I don't, maybe you know, do they use single\nor substance use treatment agency also?\nIt says in parentheses, MAT and I remember MAT coming up before.\nI am not an expert.\nI do not, I would hate to take a stab at it and be wrong.\nOkay.\nBut, Crystal probably knows exactly which agency types you guys use.\nBut like I said, it's typically going to be something like single state agency, maybe\nsubstance use treatment agency, especially if you're using SOAR most of the times.\nThe SOAR agencies need to say substance use treatment agency.\nSo we'll just say, we'll select that for now.\nAnd then the only other required field is county.\nYou just have to put which county that this agency is operating out of.\nIf the agency, what I typically say is, is if the agency operates in multiple counties,\nthen or the agency profile, select the county where that agency is headquartered.\nYou know, so like, yeah, so say they're in trying to think of some center rows,\nso, Ocalusa and, dang it, now I forgot the one in between them.\nBut say, you know, if they operate in the agency, San Rosa, Panama, City and Ocalusa County,\nthen, but they're headquartered in Ocalusa, then select Ocalusa from the drop down.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nAnd actually, this is because, this is where you live, was in Ocalusa County.\nOh.\nYeah.\nBut yeah, so you select your county and then you just click Save and Finish.\nWhen you do, which will probably throw an error at you and says that,\nyou can't save the agency record until you add at least one address.\nSo in that case, click the next button.\nAnd then that'll take you to the contact information screen and you can add your addresses.\nSo then you just have to add an address for your agency.\nWhen you click that Add Address button,\nyou'll see this address information screen, choose the Address type,\nso like, whether it's the administrative office or billing address, whatever.\nSo you, and you can add multiple addresses to an agency.\nSo like, if they have an admin office and then a billing address,\nyou can capture each of those just by clicking that Add Address button multiple times\nto add each address.\nOkay.\nSo we'll say Admin Office.\nThe Eglond Parkway.\nI'm just feeling really nostalgic today.\nI don't get to play with Florida very often.\nRight.\nIt's probably bringing back some good stuff, some good news.\nYeah, although I don't remember the zip codes.\nSo I'll just put it something.\nAll right.\nSo, happy with the address.\nYou can also add phone numbers.\nAgain, just like with Address, you can add additional phone numbers.\nThe thing to keep in mind though is that whenever you, if you add a phone number,\nthe phone number is associated with the address that you enter into the system.\nSo if you add multiple addresses, like you would see that the phone number\nwould be tied to whichever address you enter in that you add the phone numbers to.\nOkay.\nNot a big deal.\nIt really isn't.\nIt's just more for like record keeping.\nIf you want to keep, you know, if you have like an organizational structure,\nif you're OCD like I am, you know, you want things ordered in a certain way.\nAbsolutely.\nYeah.\nOtherwise, once you have the address information, if you add a phone number,\nonce all that's added in, you just click Save and Finish.\nAnd then you do have to click Save and Finish one more time once it takes you back to the address screen\nto finish saving like the agency profile and the address information.\nAnd then once you do that, it'll take you to back to the agency list screen.\nYou'll also notice that after you add in or after you create a new agency,\nit'll automatically take you into that agency.\nSo in the top right hand corner, I had started off under under a different agency,\nbut now after creating watchtower treatment, it's navigated me to the watchtower treatment agency.\nSo that tells me that anything that I do here underneath the agency menu is going to affect watchtower.\nOkay.\nSo then at which point with that, because I'm sure that would have to be changed.\nWell, for right now, doesn't need to be changed because the next step would be to then create a facility underneath the\nwatchtower treatment agency.\nBut like if you ever, so like say you started working in watchtower,\nbut you needed to change into a different agency and make some changes.\nAll you have to do is just click on the agency that you're currently in in the top right hand corner.\nAnd it'll take you to this change facility screen.\nOkay.\nAnd then you just say which new agency and facility you want to want to transfer to.\nOkay. Got it.\nSo then just make sure we do that before we make any changes, not associated with it.\nYeah.\nBut we're going to stay in watchtower because we've created the agency.\nThe next step is to create the facility.\nAnd the facility is basically your physical locations for that agency in WITS.\nSo again, if they just operate out of one location, then on the agency menu,\nyou're just going to look for facility list, clicking on facility list.\nIt'll then list any facilities that's been created for the agency or you can create new agencies.\nIf the agency only operates out of one location, then you would just add one facility.\nAnd it would be like its information, like the address information and everything else would be pretty much exactly the same as it is for the main agency.\nFor the agency profile.\nIf the agency does operate out of multiple locations, then you would select this button that says add new facility record multiple times to create each of those physical locations in WITS.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nSo clicking add new facility record will open up the facility profile screen.\nAnd then again, you'll just need to give it a name, a facility name.\nThe display name will automatically populate based off of whatever the facility name is.\nSo we'll just say watchtower.\nA.\nThe substance abuse.\nI'm inventory number. I forget exactly what all of that stands for.\nBut if you hover over it, it tells you that it's a clinic identifier for the facility for the alcohol and drug treatment services.\nSo whatever that number is is what you'll put in here.\nIt's collected by Ted's for like Ted's reporting and that sort of thing.\nYeah.\nI'm just going to put in anything for right now.\nAnd then again, you've got a lot of optional fields that you guys can complete if necessary.\nBut the only other field that needs to be completed is county again.\nSo we'll just say, I'll call you.\nAnd then click save and finish.\nThis time it's going to let let you save.\nSo whenever I click save and finish, it's going to it's just.\nWhich is going to want you to capture the physical address for your facility, but it's not a requirement.\nYeah.\nAnd in fact, what I normally tell people is that if your agency only has one physical location and it's the exact same as the agency address, then I wouldn't worry about putting in a facility address because it's the exact same as the agency address.\nRight.\nSo once your facility is created, there are additional fields.\nAnd I've didn't think that point this out, but underneath agency list and then the agency profile, there's additional things that you can capture.\nSo like we captured the address.\nOh yeah, I forgot.\nYou guys don't have as many fields.\nSo for you guys, really, it's just the fields are on the address that you have.\nBut like under facility list as well, like the facility profile, you'll see like contact special services programs, that sort of thing that you can also capture.\nBut like so if you need to, if you do need to record an address for your for your facility, underneath facility profile, you can click addresses.\nThe address screen here look exactly the same as it does for the agency, but instead you would be capturing the address specifically for that facility.\nContacts.\nIf there are any contacts at that facility that you want to record, like if there's like an office manager or something like that, then you can add them as a contact here on this screen.\nYou just click the add contact button and then add their contact information here.\nThe only stipulation to this is though is that before you can add a contact here on contact on the contact screen, they have to exist in wits for that agency and facility.\nOkay.\nSo if they haven't been added into if they have a staff member account hasn't been created for them yet in wits, they will not show up in this drop down.\nThat says staff.\nSee, like right now it's blank.\nWe're creating a brand new agency and facility.\nContacts though are not required.\nYou'll see that anytime you go to these different screens that it has required fields, it's that's the requirements in order to create that record, but the contact records are not required.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nThat's just if you need to tag contacts, that's the information that you need for it to count.\nYes, correct.\nNo, did.\nYeah, and you're going to see that while this is doing its thing trying to figure out what it's doing, you're going to see that a lot.\nAnytime that you click the like create a new record or add button, whatever screen pops up, every one of those screens are going to have required fields on them.\nAnd those are the fields that need to be completed in order to save the record, but it doesn't necessarily mean that that record needs to exist in wits.\nThat makes sense.\nYes.\nSo for example, I was saying earlier that the facility, oh, it timed out.\nIt said that the facility record, I'm sorry, I said that the facility doesn't need to have an address.\nSo if it was required, then like we would have run into the same error that whenever we try to create the agency profile.\nRight.\nYou know, what if we tried to save the agency profile, it gave us an error to say that we needed to capture an address first.\nUh, lock back in and see what happens.\nThere we go.\nBack to watch tower.\nThen click go.\nAll right. So the agency and the facility has been created. And this is what's going to happen is that once that facility gets created, you'll notice that now you'll, it'll say up in the top right hand corner, it will say the agency name as well as a facility that you just created.\nOkay.\nAnd it'll do that too.\nLike so we created a facility or watch tower a for the facility.\nIf watch tower did operate out of multiple locations, uh, watch tower.\nWhoops.\nAnd then I think it's.\nAnd then say their second facility operates out of Santa Rosa County.\nSo then what we do is once we create that second record, we click save up in the top right hand corner right now, it just says watch tower a still.\nBut like we can switch to watch tower B.\nUm, and then like make whatever changes we need to to specifically for watch tower B.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nUm, in this case, because we have watch tower a and watch tower B, I, at that point, I would typically tell people you would want to go to, like say the facility addresses screen and capture the address for each of those physical locations.\nRight.\nAnd then again, contacts, contacts.\nSo address is contacts.\nThese are all going to be tied to the agency.\nI'm sorry to the facility that we've created underneath the facility profile.\nSo like right now, I'm in watch tower a.\nAny changes that I make will be specific to facility location watch tower a.\nIf I add an address, if I add contacts or if I add programs.\nUm, and programs will need to be added to each facility to bait to denote like this type of services that they're going to be offering.\nAnd let me.\nOops.\nOh, that's what happened.\nI think I had my PowerPoint for Florida pulled up earlier.\nI think that's what happened. I think it crashed on us.\nOh, that's exciting.\nIt happens.\nAnd I think that's what caused me to get kicked out of which or cause it to refer at the page.\nBut let me pull it back up.\nI'll do that.\nAnd the reason why I'm pulling this back up is because you guys do have some differences from the like the.\nThat's sore trainings. God.\nThat's the training you wanted.\nAnd the differences between your setup and other states and I just want to make sure I don't get anything confused.\nBut yeah, agency set up.\nFacilities profile.\nYeah, programs.\nOkay. So yeah, you guys do set up programs.\nAnd you guys mainly just use width for.\nSoar. Is that correct?\nYes, at least for my for my role, because I'm just the data coordinator for all of sore.\nSo that's all I'll be using it for.\nYeah. So then yeah, definitely for each facility.\nSo right now we're in watch tower a.\nWe would need to navigate the programs and then click this button. This is add new program record.\nAnd on the screen, that's about the pop. Here we go. We've got to give we got to name the program.\nWhatever you guys.\nYou may already have like naming conventions for your programs, but I mean, this is again, mainly just an identifier.\nSo like we could say it's so or four. We could just name the program. So for start date was.\nFor so or four was like 930 2024.\nI don't. I don't like using the calendar.\nBut sometimes it tries to make me.\nBut yeah, you can type it in or you can click the calendar date by clicking the little calendar icon.\nModality.\nSo in this case, I'm just going to say sore grant. It might be something else in the live product in the live environment.\nAnd we'll say modality specifier out adult outpatient again, these are going to be based off of whatever your.\nLike criteria that you have set up in the live environment.\nNotice that sometimes a sore gets created.\nThere we go.\nAnd then so these are all the required fields that need to be completed on the program screen.\nGrant is not going to show up as a required field, but it has to be selected.\nSo in this drop down, you're going to choose the grant that's going to be associated with this program.\nThis has to be done even though it doesn't show that it's a required field, but this has to be done in order for sore to work properly for your for your agencies.\nSo like if this isn't selected, then your agencies, the like the people entering and the the gifters and stuff like that, they won't be able to see the gift.\nIf this grant is not selected, but is associated with this program.\nYeah, that's how important it is.\nOnce you have your program completed, you I'm going to click save and finish just so you can see what's going to happen.\nIt's going to throw an error at you and it's going to tell you that you have to add capacity to this program.\nYou can save.\nSo like if I click save, it'll allow me to save the record, but I can't save and leave this screen without scrolling down to the bottom and adding capacity to this program.\nSo click add new capacity and then choose your capacity type beds or slots and then whatever the daily capacity is.\nFor the most part, from what I've learned is this. So if an agency actually cares about how many slots that they can have or beds that they have, then put in whatever that number is.\nIf they don't care, then you can make the slots like a thousand, ten thousand a day, that sort of thing.\nJust makes sense. They never run out.\nYeah, especially for inpatient, I don't know if you guys offer that in Florida, but if it's an inpatient facility, maybe they only have 30 beds a day.\nSo in that case, at that point they can't take any more patients. So you would want to make sure that that daily capacity is set to say 30.\nYes, okay.\nStart date, start date should be set to, especially if you're like back, if you need to back date anything, whenever you're setting these agencies up.\nSo say we just create, we're just not getting around the creating this agency, but like they've, they've been operating. I don't know why you would do why this would be the case, but just in case, just in case, say they've been operating since the start of the new year.\nWe can always back date to start date to January 1st or whatever date.\nMake sure you do that, especially if they've actually started taking patients and they're waiting to be able to start logging that data into it.\nBecause if the start date was today and they try to add in a patient on January 1st, which is going to throw an error and say that there's no capacity available for them on January 1st.\nOkay, yeah, that was going to be my next question. So, okay.\nYep. So yeah, so back dated if you need to.\nAnd then once this program capacity set, just click save and finish.\nNow, I'll take you back to the program setup screen. And now at this point, you should be able to click save and finish to exit out.\nBut now keep in mind, we've only set this up for watch.\nYes.\nI will need to click on watch tower A up in the top right and then change my facility to watch tower B and then do the exact same thing for watch tower B.\nRight. For the program setup.\nYeah, because if one of you go to programs for watch tower B, you're going to see it's blank.\nRight.\nSo I'm just going to do that real quick.\nAnd as far as naming for the programs, the program name can be the same for each facility.\nIt, which isn't going to care. It's not going to get confused or anything like that. Right.\nAnd make sure again that the grant set will just set up capacity real quick.\nAll of it's done. Click save and finish.\nAny questions about that?\nNo, I want to say that's easy enough. I think my only thing will be remembering that I make sure that I make sure I'm doing it in the correct facility.\nOh, yeah.\nYeah. And if you make mistakes, you make mistakes. No big deal.\nIf you hover over, well, I don't think you can remove a program, but you can always turn it off. So like say we set up the wrong program for watch tower B.\nIf you hover over the vertical ellipses for that program and then go to review, you can always give it an end date.\nWhich won't let you delete the program, but you can always expire it.\nOkay. Yeah.\nSo then it'll just be like it's, it's there, but it's not there.\nCorrect. Yeah.\nGot it.\nYeah.\nLet's take a look. What else?\nWhat else?\nWe just want to know what the capacity contacts we talked about.\nYeah. So again, setting up facility contacts and setting up agency contacts, you won't be able to actually set them up until you create the start creating the staff member accounts and withs.\nI don't think you guys use special services or operating hours. I can show you what it is if you guys decide that you want to use it.\nAnd actually, special services means absolutely nothing to you guys to be honest.\nOkay.\nSpecial services is tied to another module in which called state wait list if I'm not mistaken, like 99% sure that's correct.\nSo using like listing your special services here isn't going to do anything.\nIt's not going to show up anywhere else in which to like your other agencies or anything like that.\nIt only had to do with state wait lists, which you guys don't have.\nSo if you want to operate in hours, again, this is mainly just and this right here would just be informational.\nIf you want to log the operating hours for your facilities, you can.\nSo like you can say that watch tower B maybe there are open, like say, 80 am to 5 pm.\nSo I'm putting in military time whenever I do this and then set click set.\nOh, I'll never mind. It doesn't. Some.\nSome of the screens and widths will let you do military time and then other screens will not.\nThis is one of the ones where it won't let you do military time.\nSo I've got to actually put in zero.\nAm.\nThere we go. And then you can click that button.\nThat Tuesday, this Friday, the same as Monday, if the operating hours is the same.\nBut again, this is mainly just for you. It's not going.\nThis doesn't show up anywhere else in width.\nIt doesn't get reported anywhere else in width. This is just mainly like if you want to know.\nThe hours for watch tower B, then you can log it and then you can come here and look in width.\nOr it. And then just click save and finish.\nOkay. So when it comes to adding context, I don't know.\nI don't know if you can do that until the staff is entered.\nWhen you are creating staff are like creating that user account.\nIs there a way to just add them to the program from there?\nOr would it just have to be that we create the user account and then just later on at them to the program?\nSo we have to do staff members, which is the next thing that we're going to talk about.\nRight. So like right here, where it says staff members, they have to be added as a staff member here before they will show up in the drop downs for contacts.\nYeah. So you have to create them as a staff member before you can create them here.\nYes. Okay. So do that. Save it and then come back and do.\nCorrect. Yeah.\nSo let's go ahead and do that then. So let's go to staff members.\nSomething to keep in mind whenever you're creating a staff member is that when you create a staff member, it creates it at the agency level.\nSo even though we're in watch tower treatment, watch tower B is a facility that we're currently in.\nWhenever I create a staff member, the staff members actually going to exist here in watch tower treatment.\nInside that staff member account, you'll see that we can identify whether or not they're in watch tower A or watch tower B, or maybe they're in both.\nSo you can certainly assign a staff member to both to both agents or to both facilities.\nBut yeah, whenever you create a staff member, just keep in mind that whenever you create a staff member, it's creating them under whatever the current agency is.\nLike right now we're in watch tower or watch tower treatment. So any staff members like create will be associated with watch tower treatment.\nIf I don't want them to be associated to watch tower treatment, but I want them to be associated with a different agency, then I need to change my agency by clicking on the agency in the top right hand corner and then changing to that agency.\nOkay. Yeah.\nThat makes sense. Yes, it is.\nLet's cancel. All right. So agency staff members, create a new staff member and we'll create Mr Stewart.\nJohn, not the comedian.\nThat's about to say you have any connection to him as a comedian.\nNo, so I am a huge superhero fan and one of my favorite superheroes is the Green Lantern.\nAnd there's been several Green Lanterns, but this is one of them.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah. If you ever say all of the agencies, all the staff members that I, and even my clients, they will all be superhero related.\nYou know, when I saw watch tower, I thought to ask if that was superhero related.\nThat's a league. Yeah. I love that.\nYeah. So whenever you go to Creatures staff member, the only thing that you have to add in is their first name, last name and their gender.\nThe other fields, and I clicked out of it before I click save first or too quickly, but like these other fields are just optional.\nYou have a preferred name or a middle name that you want to capture you certainly can, but these are the only three fields that are, that are required first, last and gender.\nOkay.\nAnd this actually allows me to show you this too.\nSo if you ever need to make changes to a staff member account, would you go to the staff member screen, hover over the vertical ellipsis to the right of their name, and then just click few profile to go into it.\nOkay. So the staff member workspace, you're going to have sections on the left that are automatically get added.\nSo like the employment employment profile section is automatically added. And I can see that here the profile is obviously automatically added.\nAnd then the user account pieces are automatically added. So these three sections will automatically get added.\nAny additional sections for the staff member account can be added by clicking on additional items on the right hand side.\nSo for example, this agency has two facilities. If I wanted to say identify which facilities that this person had access to or was assigned to, then I could click on add facility assignment and then choose which or both.\nSo if they're just in watch tower a I can choose watch tower a if they're in both I can select both.\nAnd then you had to put in an effective start date. So when do they get access to watch tower a.\nSo and again, this can be back dated as well. I can put in January first instead of January 8th. And then click save the in date doesn't need to be added. You can leave this blank.\nOkay, end date would only need to be added if you're giving somebody temporary access to another facility.\nSo maybe they're only going to be helping out say at watch tower B for a couple of weeks. Then you could give them access to watch tower B for that particular time frame. And then after that point, then they will no longer have access to watch tower B and widths.\nOkay, and that'll just be based on what we said if needed.\nCorrect. Yeah.\nBut yeah, so once you set your facilities, you can just click save.\nSomething to keep in mind is this. So on the right hand side, you'll see where it says completion requirements.\nYou've got the start date staff member type in email address. These three fields are required in order for this staff member to show up in any drop downs.\nSo like in order to be able in order to be able to add them as a contact, for example, they need those three, these three completion requirements need to be completed in order for them to show up in a drop down on the client profile screens.\nLike as a like the attending physician or something like that, these, these three fields have to be completed at minimum.\nYeah. So easiest way to add these is just click on it. So where it says employee employment start day, click on that.\nIt'll, which will automatically take you to the employment profile section and open it up so that you can add the client that users or staff members start day.\nYou'll also, so the staff member type also needs to be added and that is also here underneath the employment profile.\nWhere it says staff member type, you would just choose the staff, click on it. And then you can say like what their role is. We'll say that they're an administrator in this case and then click save.\nSomething to keep in mind is that even though I identified this, this staff member as an administrator, it doesn't assign any roles like administrator roles to the, to that staff members account.\nOkay. Yeah. That's just for identifying purposes like in the menus and stuff like that and wits.\nOkay. Right. And then the last completion requirement is to add an email address. Again, if you just click on add email address, it'll take you.\nOne, it'll add contact information from the additional items section on the right hand side to the left. You'll see you can see like it's grayed out, but you can see it in the background.\nYeah. Yeah. And then you can add an email address. So we'll just say I'm just going to put in my name or email address.\nThat's not right.\nThere you go. And you can choose whether or not it's the primary address or email address as well. And then just click save.\nAnd then that takes care of the completion requirements. That means that now this person will show up underneath contact. So I can add them as a contact for my facility and my agency.\nAnd they'll show up in any other drop downs that has to do with staff members as well. Okay.\nGot it. So completion requirements first and then it can be added. Okay.\nYeah. Now everything that we've done so far is just setting the person up as a to show up as a staff member in your agency and our facilities.\nThat does not give them access to wits though. Got it. Okay. So we just give them an identity. Right.\nFor them to now be a user in wits, we have to add a user account to them to their to their staff member account.\nSo if you click user account or you can scroll through the middle section of the workspace to where it says user account and then click add user account.\nWhen you do is going to ask you to put in a user ID. Whatever you guys have decided to like whatever conventions you've decided for your user accounts. That's what you would use.\nI don't know if Crystal has anything set up that says it needs to be like first name dot last name or maybe it's first initial last name. That sort of thing.\nI can't spell today. But that's what you would put in as their staff member.\nThey're user ID for logging into it and then click create account.\nIf an account already exists, then you could say like j stuer and then add a number behind it. So I'll just say j stuer one and then click create account.\nSo when you create the user account, it's going to use whatever email address we had added here underneath contact information.\nAs the primary. If for some reason you hadn't added the email account yet and then you go to staff like user accounts and then go to add.\nAdd the create their user account here and you had an and you have not added an email address yet. Then which will ask you to add the email address at this time as well.\nSo either order like you can go straight to user account give the person a user ID and it'll also ask you to identify their email address.\nAnd it'll automatically add it to the contact information for you.\nOkay, this is there. Yeah.\nOnce this staff member has a user account created, you then need to add roles. Something to keep in mind though is, and I apologize, I've got my rules set up and it's immediately dump it into into deleted.\nHere we go. When you create a staff or a user account for for a person in width, they're going to get to email address. They're going to get two emails from from width.\nThe first is going to let them know that and user ID was created for them and here it is.\nAnd then the second email is going to say click this link.\nAnd then it's setting up your account. Okay, I remember getting those when I was given an account.\nYep, they get that immediately that as soon as you create their staff, their user account here, they immediately get that email.\nSo if you stop and you don't do anything else and then they finish setting up their account and they try to log in, which is going to tell them that they don't have access because you haven't set up any roles yet.\nOkay. Yep. So after you create their user account for them, you need to click here where it says manage roles above agency roles and then add at least one role to their account so that they can start accessing widths.\nSo like maybe they're going to be an administrator for the agency. In that case, you know, you can, when you bring up agency roles, you can search for it.\nYou can also, like, so you can scroll through this list. Me personally, I like to just search for a keyword. So in this case, like admin and it will show me every role that has admin, either in the name of the role or in the description.\nAnd then you just click that little plus symbol to the to the right of the role and it adds it over as an assigned role.\nAnd if you want to see what roles are included, so like agency administrator is the name of the role, but it actually has other roles bundled into it. If you want to see what those roles are, just click where it says view included roles within that, within that role that you're signing in, it'll tell you all the roles that they'll have access.\nOkay. Like all the things they could do. Okay. Yeah.\nAnd then of course that there are any other roles, like clinical related or anything like that. Again, me personally, I just do a search for the for the keyword and then go from there. And then once I have all the roles added, then I just click I am done.\nAnd then that'll take you back to them staff member workspace. You'll see that the roles have been added. And then that's it.\nAll right. And then they need that because if they set up their thing, it'll just be like, all right, cool. You have an account, but you can't do anything. So exactly.\nAll right. Yeah.\nNow, something else to keep in mind is maybe you want to add someone as a staff member, but you don't want to give them access to wits. In that case, you just won't create a user account for them.\nSo it is possible to create a staff member so that they show up and drop down menus and stuff like that.\nOkay. Without giving them an actual user account in wits.\nOkay. So would that just be just more of record keeping? Right. Yeah.\nYeah, because I think like in some cases, I've seen some states where they'll have like attending physicians.\nSo they might have like a physician, a doctor or whatever that goes in and they see the patients, but those doctors aren't actually going into wits and logging any information is like a clinician or somebody else at the right.\nSo the doctors still have might need to be listed as a staff member to the show up and drop downs, but they don't need to have access to wits.\nSo in that case, you don't need to create a user account for them. Okay. Let me get. Yeah.\nThese additional items over on the right hand side, you can click and add them if you need to, but there are none of these are required.\nThe only requirements show up underneath the completion requirements and we already set them. Right. Okay.\nFacility assignments though. Facility assignments.\nIt's not going to show up as a requirement, but if you assign, if you create a user account, then you're going to want to assign facilities as well, because you need to, you basically need to tell wits which facilities this user has access to.\nRight.\nWhether it's one facility to facilities, multiple facilities for that agency or what, but yeah, you do need to identify which facilities that user account has access to.\nIf you don't, then whenever the person logs in, they'll just see the agency screens and they won't be able to do anything else. They won't be able to navigate. Yeah.\nSo it definitely needs to specify. Yeah. What they can, or which agency or facility they could do. Yeah.\nAny questions about staff member accounts? Nope. That was painless.\nLet's see. There is something else with regards to staff member accounts. I cannot remember for the life of me. All of a sudden. Where is it?\nDoesn't it always happen that way?\nWell, I mean, I kind of remember, but I'm like, I don't want to mess it up. Not agency roles. Staff members system. That was it. Oh, well, actually, let's go back a step first before we go to system roles.\nAll right. So if I exit, I'm going to exit out of my staff member account and go back to the staff member, staff member search screen.\nSo here's Mr. Stewart that we've set up at Watchtower treatment. If I ever need to lock agency access.\nIt's like say he doesn't work for Watchtower anymore. If I hover over the vertical ellipsis, I can click here where it says lock agency access.\nSo when you do is going to give ask for a reason to lock the account down. So like say terminate it or they left or whatever and then click lock.\nAnd then that's like the quickest and easiest way to lock someone out of wits.\nAnd they remain locked. So like I'll even do it.\nSo I lock it and it says that the lock was successful.\nThey can't get in and into wits anymore at this point.\nAnd the only way that they can get access to wits again is for me to go back to their account hover over the vertical ellipsis and click this where it says release agency lock.\nAnd again, it's going to say locked by lock reason release.\nIt's supposed to ask for a reason to unlock it. I don't know why it's not.\nBut it typically will and it may just be the training environment, but it'll ask you to put in a reason for unlocking their account.\nOkay, and then they'll have access back into wits at that point.\nRight. Yeah. So like say someone goes on maternity leave. You could lock their access while they're on maternity leave and then unlock it when they return.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nWhere it says reset credentials. So when a user puts in their password incorrectly more than two times.\nSo on that third and correct attempt to log in, it'll lock out their account.\nIt'll be an issue recently. Yeah.\nIt'll say that their accounts locked. It's not it's not this locked though. It's not this lock agency access right here. Right.\nBasically all you need to do is just click reset credentials for that user and it'll recent.\nIt'll basically send a new email link to them saying here click this to reset your login credentials.\nSo if they get themselves locked out, you just click reset credentials. It'll unlock their account and then send them an email to reset their password and pen.\nOkay. So then that'll art easy.\nYeah. Yeah. Super easy.\nYeah.\nThe only other thing with regards to user accounts is if a user needs access to more than one agency.\nSo right now he only has this person only has access to watch tower treatment.\nThey also need access to other agencies. In that case you have to add. So let me go back into the view profile screen real quick and let's go to.\nLet's scroll down to where it says user accounts. Notice this manage roles button is only just above where it says agency roles, but there's also system roles.\nSystem roles can only be added on underneath system administration from the left navigation menu.\nYeah, system roles can be added to a staff member account underneath agency. Underneath agency and staff member they have it has to be added underneath system administration.\nOkay.\nAnd then system account.\nOkay.\nSo if I go to system accounts do a search for Mr. Stewart.\nI think I'm going to find that he's here multiple places. Yeah.\nI hover over the vertical ellipsis and then click view profile underneath to the right of that user's name.\nAnd then here you'll notice one everything's kind of locked down so you have to click the added button up in the top right.\nSo that you can then make changes, but you'll see system roles and then agency roles and you can add agency roles to the users account here.\nSo like if you're if you needed to give him some system role to access, but then you are like, oh yeah, I'll see you to add these agency roles agency specific roles.\nThen you can add them here as well.\nYeah, all of that can be done in system, but only agency stuff can be done in agency.\nCorrect. You can also own you can't create system.\nYou can't create user accounts underneath system accounts.\nOkay. That has to be agency. Okay.\nYeah. So the user has to be created at the agency level first and then you go to system administration system accounts and then you can add additional roles to the user here.\nTypically this is the system accounts.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nSo let's say that Mr. Stewart needs to have access to multiple agencies.\nSo here underneath system account where it says system roles, we're going to click manage roles.\nAnd then underneath available roles, we're going to do a search for oversight.\nAnd you'll see these three options.\nYou can give him access access all oversight agencies and read only mode with report view.\nThat means that he can access other agent, the other agencies that will assign to him, but he can't change the data.\nHe can't manipulate it. He can only view it.\nSo if you can access all oversight agencies and read, read right mode will give him access to view and make changes.\nSo like in that case, he could potentially go into a client record and make changes to that client record.\nYeah. So just be aware of like what kind of access this person actually needs whenever you go to the office.\nYeah. I've got to be careful with that one.\nThere is another role and I don't know why it automatically assigned.\nDid I click on the wrong John Stewart? I did click on the wrong.\nPossibly.\nI was like, wait a second. I thought there was a third role. Here we go.\nSorry.\nAll right. And then there's also access all oversight agencies and read only mode.\nSo read only mode with reports, give them access to reporting also, but read only mode just gives them the ability to like look at data.\nThey can't run reports or anything like that.\nAnd then this forward one, don't assign to people. That's for like you.\nYeah. For you and other at state admins.\nBecause only you guys should be giving people the ability to access or giving people the ability to like grant or revoke oversight access.\nWhich is basically meaning taking these roles off of a user account or adding it to a user account.\nRight. So we'll say that we're going to give them read only access.\nSo if we click the button to the right, the little plus symbol to the right of that role, it moves it over to assign roles.\nAnd then we click I am done.\nIf there were other roles that we needed to assign to Mr. Stewart, we certainly could.\nOtherwise, if we're completely done, then we just click done editing.\nOkay.\nOne more thing about system accounts and agency accounts is that there are some roles that are specific.\nAt the system level and at the agency level, what do I mean by that?\nI believe it's agency. So like Gipra.\nRight. Gipra full access.\nSo this shows up underneath agency roles. I'm pretty sure it does not show up here.\nIf I remember correctly.\nNo, that wasn't it.\nBut actually so like additional.\nSo like these update and or delete accepted Gipra is this is was here.\nI don't believe I saw it underneath the agency.\nOh wait, no.\nBut yeah, but there was a yeah, but you see what I'm saying.\nSome roles will only show up underneath system under system roles.\nAnd then some will only show up underneath agency.\nAnd I think I know it has to do with the Gipra and I think it was maybe the dashboard.\nAh, I could build today.\nGrant management dashboard.\nI believe this is it.\nUnless they've made some changes to it.\nDash.\nYeah. See, so like the grant management dashboard is at the agency level,\nbut it's not at the system level.\nYeah. So just be aware of that.\nSome of the roles are specific at the system level and some of them are specific at the agency level.\nWhich ones.\nI'm still working on trying to get a complete list because I don't think anybody's ever bothered to write it all down.\nBut I am trying to I am slowly trying to create a list of like what all the roles are and everything that they do and where they show up.\nBut yeah.\nBut yeah, so we added this agency oversight role to give this person access to multiple multiple agencies.\nOnce even though we've added that role to their account though, they still don't have access to any other agencies other than watch our treatment.\nThe next thing that needs to be done to give a person access to multiple agencies is underneath system administration.\nWhere is it?\nAgency oversight assignment.\nSo system administration agency oversight assignment.\nAnd then you have to select which agency that user is currently in.\nSo we'll do a search for watch tower.\nAnd then which staff member we're looking for.\nThe only staff members that are going to show up in this drop down are staff members that have an oversight role assigned to them.\nSo if they don't have an oversight, they won't show up in this list.\nOkay.\nSo we're going to select Mr. Stewart and then we're going to say which of these other agencies he has access to.\nSo we'll say it.\nLike training provider agency and then trainer provider agency one.\nAnd normally if you click it select I click provider agency for and then I click provider one.\nNow it's just provider one instead of provider agency for and provider one.\nSo you have to hold down the left control key.\nOkay.\nAnd then it'll let you select multiple.\nThat.\nBut yeah, so once you have those agencies is selected, you just click the little right arrow and it'll move it over to agency selected.\nAnd then here is this filtered access.\nIf you click the drop down, it's going to say, are you filtering their that that users access like intake access.\nThis is like client records and stuff like that or are we not filtering it.\nSo filtered access or no filtered access to client records.\nIf I select no filtered access.\nWhich is going to throw up this message and saying, hey, are you sure you want to do this?\nHip violations and all that.\nAnd then you have to choose yes or no.\nOkay.\nSo there's some warnings set in place to make sure you really want to do what you try to do.\nYeah.\nSo we'll say no filtered access and then click save and finish.\nAnd now whenever Mr Stewart logs in, he'll have access to watch tower as well as his other two agencies that we just assigned to his account.\nAnd he'll have the same role for like we gave him agency administrator access to watch tower treatment.\nHe'll also have agency administrator access to those other two agencies as well.\nRight.\nAny questions about user accounts?\nNo, but what's following that makes sense?\nOkay.\nYou probably will not have to worry about this because this is typically in what the agency administrator does.\nBut let's see.\nDo we have.\nLet's go to training provider agency and see what we've got.\nThere may not be anything set up.\nOkay. No worries.\nBut here underneath agency.\nAnd then underneath agency list, you've got referrals.\nIf you click referrals, you've got referrals and then referrals out.\nSo an agency can see referrals that are coming into their agency.\nSo if I click referrals and do a search, then I can see any referrals that have come in.\nI can also search for specific types of referrals.\nSo like referrals that are in a pending status.\nFor example, and it will show me just those referrals.\nAnd then.\nSo the reason why I'm pointing this out is not really anything that you're going to be dealing with.\nBut you might have people that ask have some questions about it.\nIf they have a referral that's like an appending status, they can come here hover over the vertical ellipses for that referral.\nAnd then go to review.\nAnd it will take them into the referral record.\nAnd then from there, they can change the referral status to accepted.\nOkay.\nIf there's ever any question of, hey, this person got referred into my agency.\nBut I can't see them.\nIf they haven't changed that status to accept it and then click save and finish, then with won't create this client in their system.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nAlso, it'll have to be accepted.\nAnd then.\nYeah.\nDoes have to be accepted.\nOnce it's accepted, the clients record will get created in their agency immediately.\nLike it'll in which will even navigate to that clients record.\nOh, yes.\nYeah, as soon as they accept the referral, it'll take them.\nIt'll create the record for their agency and take them directly to it.\nSo they can start working with the client.\nBut they have to change that referral status to place.\nAccepted.\nFor you, since we're underneath agency list announcements,\nannounce the referral status to place.\nAccepted.\nFor you, since we're underneath agency list announcements,\nif agency list announcements,\nannouncements allows you to create system messages,\neither for every agency or specific agencies or maybe even for specific user accounts.\nBut this is a good way to throw out any general announcements.\nAgain, it all depends on how you want to use this.\nIt's not a requirement, but I find it to be pretty useful.\nSo if you want to let your providers know that your offices are going to be closed on certain days,\nlike you got Martin Luther King coming up, right?\nIf you click add new announcement, you can say offices closed.\nAnd then under details, you can give it more specific details.\nIt can be pretty simple, just like a brief message that says like what's coming up.\nAnd then the details you can put into more detailed information.\nThe offices will be I believe it's January 20th.\nI like that something I should definitely know.\nOh, I'm terrible with a.\nI always have to check.\nYep, 20th is the 20th.\nAnd then you can give it a priority higher normal.\nI'm just going to select high real quick, just so we can see what it looks like.\nAnd then a start date and you can even give it an end date also.\nActually, we'll say the 21st.\nSo you can say that the message starts sewing up on say January 1st.\nAnd then it will stop showing after January 20th or after January 20th.\nOkay.\nAnd date.\nAgency will automatically default to whatever the state agency is.\nYou can click on it to bring up the strap down and then click this blank.\nIf this is blank for agency and these other fields are blank,\nthen this announcement will show for every agency in widths.\nIf I only want this announcement to show for certain agencies,\nor well, in this case for one agency,\nbecause they see that are like one or all,\nyou can't hold down control and click on multiple, unfortunately.\nBut like if I only wanted this message,\nmessage just show for department of children and families,\nthen I could choose that one specific agency.\nI could also do it by agency type.\nSo if I want this to only show for my substance use treatment,\nwhich actually is pretty much should be like all of your agencies,\nthen you can choose like substance use treatment agency MAT.\nYou can also have it showed just for certain users.\nSo like depending on the roles,\nso like people that have access to all agencies or people that have\naccess to all agencies,\nthey have access to all agencies,\nso like if you are in the same group,\nyou can choose one of these other roles,\nand it's all the roles.\nYeah.\nSo I mean it can be a pretty long list.\nBut once you have those all filled out,\nyou just click save and finish.\nAnd if they are going to have access to all of them,\nyeah.\nAnd if they will be an arrow to the right,\nif they click on it,\nthen they can see the detailed message.\nSo summary and then the details.\nAnd then who created it in the start date?\nYeah.\nSo yeah.\nAnd then the reference.\nReferrals.\nTalked about.\nReferrals.\nSo there is referrals and then referrals out.\nI don't know how many of your providers will need to look at the referrals\nthat they put out.\nBut if they want to like see any referrals that they've created to other agencies,\nunderneath referrals,\nthey can click referrals out and then do a search\nfor referrals are if there are any.\nLet me switch.\nThe only time that I can think of that they may need to do this is say they created a referral.\nActually, I don't even think it'll let them though from here.\nIf I could refurls out.\nI guess one I've created referrals that that no, I guess not.\nIt'll show them the referrals that they have been created for their agency.\nBut like say they don't want that referral anymore.\nI think it'll let them either they can they can cancel the referral here\nor they'll have to go into the client record and cancel the referral.\nI apologize.\nI can't remember that off the top of my head.\nNo problem.\nBut yeah.\nI don't know how often that they will be using that function or this functionality though, honestly.\nAnd then of course you've got the grant management dashboard and Gipra.\nGrant management dashboard is probably going to be more for you all\nthan it will be for your providers.\nThis is the training environment.\nI don't really show anything.\nBut this will show you the grant management dashboard can show you information on like all the Gipra's across all the different agencies\nand tell you how many of them, you know, they like to follow up do\nwhether or not they're being completed in that five to eight month window.\nThat sort of thing.\nGipra by race, Gipra by follow up compliance, gender identity, grant episode details, all that kind of good stuff.\nOkay.\nIs he in there?\nYeah.\nAnd it's just reporting on the Gipra.\nAnd for the most part, like the data is just kind of like, I mean, it's there.\nYou can see it.\nYou can't really do anything with it other than I think the Gipra, even though it's not showing up.\nThe Gipra follow up do.\nI believe it will show like individual use, individual clients.\nAnd then you can go into their client records from here.\nYou can also like grant where it says grant episode details.\nYou can also see that it will show you different clients as well.\nIt's not going to give you the client's name.\nIt's just going to give you their client number though.\nMm-hmm.\nYeah.\nAnd I guess it doesn't let you go into the client records anymore.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nSo like you could copy this and then go into that, select this agency service provider one.\nYou could always copy this unique client number, then go move to that agency and then do a search for the client.\nAnd then go search that.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nBut these other reports, these are going to be pretty important to your providers, especially like this follow up do detail.\nThis is probably going to be the most important one for them.\nAnd I'll show you why.\nSo we'll go to follow up do detail.\nAnd we'll do sore three for the grant.\nSo whenever you get to the any of these screens where there, whether it's a discharge do follow up do summary or follow up do detail.\nIt's going to ask you to select which grant you want to report on.\nSelect sore three.\nSo last one that you guys had.\nSo that's why I chose that and then we'll just click search.\nThe status by the way will automatically default to within window.\nOkay.\nYou can change that status though if you need to.\nBut I tell people like choose your grant.\nLeave the status to within window and run it.\nAnd which will tell you any.\nGipras that are in that five day month window because that's what that means within window.\nRight.\nSo any of those Gipras that are in that six month, five day month window.\nThen they'll show up here.\nAnd then your providers can use this screen to say, oh, I've got this person that's, you know, the Gipra that six month was supposed to be done on the 26th.\nSo I need to, you know, I need to get on it.\nYou know, I need to like go into that client's record and do that six month follow up.\nSo they've got that person listed here.\nIf they hover over the vertical ellipsis and then click view, it'll take them into that client record.\nTake them to the Gipra assessment screen so that they can start that six month follow up.\nSo this is, I think, a very helpful report for them because it'll let them know which ones are coming up due for that six month follow up.\nIf they use this on a regular basis, then they shouldn't have any that are, say, noncompliant or missed.\nBut this is also a helpful page for you guys as well because you guys can always say like you can go to missed status, noncompliant status and run it because you guys will have the ability to see all agencies.\nThey're only going to be able to see their agency information, but like you guys can run this report and say, you know, service provider one.\nWhy did they keep having all these miss Gipra follow ups?\nYou know, what's going on?\nYes, we're going to address those if necessary.\nYou're right.\nExactly.\nYep.\nWhat else?\nFirls.\nDo you all use the Naloxone overdose reversal kits?\nYes.\nI mean, I don't know what I'm that's on.\nAre you guys using with to track it?\nI guess.\nThat part I don't know the answer to.\nI know it's been brought up before, but I don't know whether we track it in in with surf.\nThey track it somewhere else.\nI want to say somebody else.\nThat's not part of the reports that I myself run.\nI don't know if I do not track it, but somebody else does.\nRight.\nYeah.\nAnd I'm not sure that they use it in with because I so I know that those things have to be reported.\nAnd reporting the like recording the overdose reversal kits in withs is nice, but I don't think that that data gets reported out anywhere.\nI could be right.\nBut like that's something something that we can always ask crystal about.\nBut since you're not going to be responsible for that, we won't worry about talking about it.\nDo you guys are we be running reports?\nI believe so.\nI'll at least need to know how to in the evictus she asked for it.\nRight.\nAnd I'm trying to think I don't know if you guys use SSRS reporting or not.\nI don't know.\nBut yeah, the Gipra discharge do Gipra follow up do summary Gipra follow up do detail.\nYou can run these reports at any time.\nSo even though like you do a search here and it pulls the data here on this page, you've got this export button.\nIf you click on it, it'll allow you to save it as an Excel spreadsheet to your desktop.\nSo then you can save it in a file or I'm in a folder name it, whatever you want to click save.\nAnd then you'll have that report and it'll show you like all this information.\nActually, let me do that real quick.\nI'll show you all the report information it shows.\nNot Alabama Scott.\nI mean, these are just my personal folders anyway on like for working and stuff.\nBut there we go.\nSave.\nOnce you, once you save it, you just click hover over the little download button up at the top right of your browser and then click on the report and it'll open it up.\nAnd it's going to say, hey, it uses a funky format. Just click yes.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nThere we go.\nSo unique client number.\nSo it's going to give you like their client number, their name, agency and basically everything that we were just looking at on the screen.\nRight.\nSo give her intake date, due date, follow up date, follow up open date and follow up close date.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nThere's also other reports.\nSo you've got reports here on the right hand side of the screen.\nIf you click on that, it'll take you to reporting screen.\nSo you'll, you'll see like the report catalog and it lists a bunch of different reports.\nI don't know if any of these will pertain to you though, to be honest, because none of them have to do with the Gipra.\nWell, then it probably won't.\nYeah.\nI think most of the reporting that you're going to have is here underneath agency.\nI got it.\nAnd then these three.\nThe only other thing I can think of is if you guys are using SSRS reports, in which case, if you have SSRS reports, then up here.\nAnd what we call the global header where it says like Florida, which helped us can snapshot, you'll see an option that says SSRS reports.\nAnd you can click on that and then there are specific reports within SSRS that have been set up for the state.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nI've seen that.\nI'll skip for a report as well.\nYeah.\nWhich.\nSo if you have seen that.\nOkay.\nSo I don't have, I don't think I have a screenshot of those reports.\nDo I not hear.\nBut I always doesn't show me like the reports themselves anyway, but that SSRS reports on the Gipra can be very helpful.\nBecause of this, if we go to system administration, where are you?\nSpars batch errors.\nSo system administration, spars batch errors.\nAnd then it's not going to show me anything because we're in a training environment, but like you do a search and you know, you can say like which, which.\nGipra's were rejected.\nSo that's what that current record status rejected is.\nAnd do a search.\nIt'll show you all the, the Gipra's that were rejected by spars for whatever reason.\nSo it'll show that list here.\nYou're better off using SSRS reports though.\nSo if you do that, there is an SSRS reports reports on spars batch errors.\nAnd it'll pull all this information for you as well.\nYeah.\nI want to say I've seen it just while I've been like playing around getting familiar with it. I know I know I've seen it.\nYeah.\nTo me, I like that report better because it's cleaner than just clicking this export button and downloading it as.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBut yeah.\nSo like that's a nice.\nThat I think is going to be a very helpful report for you.\nI know it has been very helpful for other states to see the spars batch errors that they've received so that they can then like send that information to individual agencies and say, hey, these.\nThese Gipra's were rejected by spars going to find out why.\nAnd that report will tell you it'll have like the error code on it and tell you like this is why it was.\nWhy spars rejected it?\nGot it.\nSometimes the error messages make sense and sometimes they don't unfortunately.\nBecause it is it can be worded kind of technical.\nAnd that, you know, the technical wording on it sometimes confuses people, but yeah.\nIt will tell you why those Gipra's were rejected.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nWell, at least for a reason, even if it makes no sense.\nI don't know why.\nWhat else?\nAnnouncements alerts.\nThis is something that you guys have access to.\nI don't know if you're using it.\nExcuse me.\nSo on the homepage, if I'm an agency or user at an agency, say I'm responsible for completing Gipra's.\nHere underneath the alert list, alerts can be set up to alert agencies whenever, like say, the six month follow up is coming up to you.\nAnd it'll show up in alert here that says, hey, this client is due for their six month follow up.\nThat sort of thing.\nOr you can put in and you can I think you can also create alerts to say like.\nHey, the status of this Gipra is still an open. It's not been completed.\nFor example, so if we go to system administration and then go to alert types.\nThe alert types are what's used to create alerts.\nAnd this is a very long list of alerts.\nQuite a few.\nUnfortunately, there's no search function on this screen for some reason.\nI don't know why.\nBut if you do a control F to bring up your web browser search and then say like typing Gipra.\nIt'll show you.\nHere's a Gipra follow up due.\nHere's a discharge Gipra creation follow up Gipra creation intake Gipra creation.\nThat sort of thing.\nSo there are some alerts that have been added into or that are listed here with regards to the Gipra.\nSo let's let's look at the Gipra follow up due right here.\nWhat you're looking for is see this column that says enabled and it says key.\nSome of them might say F.\nF stands for false T stands for true.\nOkay.\nThis is yeah, it's whenever this page was created, it was very much created in the computer logic kind of sense.\nSo true means on or you know true means on or one and then false means off or zero right.\nSo you want to make sure that this status is enabled.\nSo we're looking for a T.\nAll right, cool.\nIf we don't want it, we can always hover over the vertical ellipsis and then click disable and it'll change that from enabled T to enabled F.\nYes.\nOkay.\nSo let's go ahead and enable it.\nSo now that we have that alert type enabled for the Gipra follow up due.\nI can then go to agency from the left navigation menu and go down to where it says alerts configuration.\nAnd then create an or add a new alert.\nAnd then the configuration type by agency or by agency type.\nIf this is only if this so if you're creating this alert only for one agency, then you would choose agency.\nIf you're wanting to create it for an agency type, say all of your store agencies choose agency type.\nAnd then choose your agency type from the drop down.\nOh, like substance use treatment agency.\nThen you give that alert a name.\nSo Gipra.\nSix month.\nFollow up alert type.\nAnd you'll have to scroll through the list or you can do a search by typing in the name.\nSo here we go.\nSo what do you do when you select your alert type, you're going to notice that the trigger point alert category and the alert description will automatically populate for you.\nSo trigger point.\nThis is this is something to keep note of because down here it says when is the next activity due days after the trigger point.\nSo notice it says that the trigger point is the Gipra intertake interview date.\nSo typically six months after that intake interview is when the follow up is due.\nSo that's what we'll say 180 days.\nWhat message should appear to users?\nThis is whatever you want it to be, but you could say like six month follow up is or six month.\nSix month follow up window is open for this client.\nAnd then how many days prior to the due date should this alert show up?\nSo this is the six month mark.\nFive months.\nSo that's roughly 30 days.\nSo we'll stay 150.\nSo 150 days before the due date, which staff member should receive the message.\nSo maybe whoever's assigned to the case or maybe if they have a Gipra full access or whatever the case is, but you choose like who would see this alert?\nShould the message turn red when it's overdue?\nYes or no?\nI mean personally, yes.\nFor all their attention to a please.\nYes.\nAnd then when should they stop receiving this message?\nSo then 180 plus 60 is what about 240, right?\nYes.\nAnd then when does this alerts take effect?\nSo we can say January 1st and then click save and finish.\nNotice there was also an option.\nYou expire.\nOops, I did not mean to click delete.\nThere is also an option at the bottom and expiration date.\nYou only need to set this if this alert is only going to be available for so many for a certain amount of time.\nOr like if you're never going to use it again, or not I shouldn't say never going to use again.\nIf you're not going to use it anymore, you can always expire it.\nI personally like to do that because if you ever decide later to come back and use it again, you can always wipe out the expiration date and then that that alert will start working again.\nIf you deleted, you got to start.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nRight.\nYeah.\nSo if you ever create an alert and you're like, I'm not we're not using this, but we might again at some point then don't delete it.\nJust just expire it.\nAnd then if you ever decide to use it again, you can always go back and and unexpire it.\nYeah.\nI will say this though, alerts do not work in the training environments.\nYeah.\nSo I mean it's good practice to like come in here and just play around with setting it up, but you won't ever really get it to work in a training environment.\nIt only works in the live environment.\nThere's a couple of function functions that only work in the live environment.\nSelect a GIPRA that grant management dashboard, live environment alerts are live environment.\nThere was something else too and I can't think of it for the life of me all of a sudden.\nWe'll see if I remember.\nBut yeah, there are a couple of things that only work in the live environment though.\nOh, oh, yeah.\nNow I remember has to do with SSRS reports.\nOnly in the live environment can you set up reports to run automatically.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nI'll point that out because I don't know how many times I've tried to do training on setting up what they call subscriptions.\nIn SSRS reports and it won't work because it only works in the live environment.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nBut subscriptions are nice though.\nSo like in SSRS reports, if you set up a subscription, you can say generate the Spars batch of reports for me nightly.\nAnd it'll be waiting for you the next day when it will be coming.\nMake your job as easy as possible, right?\nYeah.\nI'm just going to say I love to do that.\nOh, yeah.\nAll of the conveniences that I can find I love to take advantage of.\nAbsolutely.\nWho doesn't?\nAlerts.\nHode tables.\nAll right.\nAlso underneath system administration.\nSo just want to point out real quick though.\nSo when we were, I was talking about setting up an alert.\nJust remember you have to go to alert types first and make sure that the alerts active.\nOkay.\nAnd then you have to go to agency.\nAnd then alerts configuration.\nEven though the alert can be set up to display for all agencies.\nIt's not alerts aren't configured at the system level.\nThey're configured at the agency level.\nGot it.\nYeah.\nDon't know why it's set up that way.\nI know it causes some confusion though.\nSo I like to make sure I point that out.\nThat you have to go to do to that you have to go to two different places to set up a more.\nSystem administration.\nYou also have what we call code tables.\nI don't know how often you all need to worry about code tables.\nI really don't.\nBut if you ever need to make changes to a code table, this is where you go.\nSo what's a code table?\nLet's go back to agency and let's go to facility because underneath facility you have contacts.\nSo if I go to add a contact and you see this drop down right here where it says contact type.\nAnd it only gives me the contact type of clinical licensing and referrals.\nWell, what if I want an additional contacts to types to be listed here?\nThis is controlled by a code table.\nSo the values that list here, the values that list that you'll see for any drop down menus or what we call mover boxes are controlled by the code tables.\nWhat's a what's a mover box?\nMover box is let's go to I think we can do it with agency profile.\nYeah. So agency profile see where it says agency features right here.\nThis is a mover box.\nSo you have some options here on the left hand side that you can move over to the right hand side where it says selected agency felt features.\nSo you'll basically have an available box and then a selected box.\nSo your code tables control the drop downs, the drop down menus and the mover box menus for options that display.\nSo if you ever have an option that's not showing and you want to have it at.\nSo if you want to add it so that it is shown and it can be selected by other users, then you can go to system administration code tables find the code table and question and then click go to go in and make changes to those available options.\nOK.\nYeah.\nIt can get a little bit technical and like some of the code tables are not necessarily easy to find.\nSo for example, I know this is not going to show up contact.\nOh, now maybe I don't think this is that those staff contact role.\nI don't think it's going to show me the right thing.\nOh wait.\nThere's a expired.\nOh no, it's not so like see these agency billing contact executive fiscal.\nThese did not show up in the drop downs for these are contact types, but I think these are contact types specific to the agency record agency contacts on facility contacts.\nOK.\nYeah.\nBecause see like these options we're not showing for us clinical licensing and referral.\nI think showed for us.\nOh, wait.\nThose two did.\nYeah.\nAnd I see now why OK.\nSo see where this is contact entity type code and it says unit or agency agency means that this option shows up under the agency contact screen unit or facility.\nSo why they didn't name it facility.\nRight.\nMeans that this these options show up underneath the facility level.\nSo like say we wanted to add a new contact type.\nIf I click new, nothing appears to happen.\nYou have to scroll down and then you'll see the the the field for that code table.\nSo contact role code.\nSo just got to give it a name.\nWe'll say.\nYou.\nA.\nDescription.\nFacility.\nAdmin.\nStraighter.\nContact entity type.\nWe'll say unit.\nAnd then we'll say it's safe and finish.\nLet's see if it worked.\nIf I go back to facility list, go to contacts.\nAdd a contact.\nNice.\nI swear to you.\nI don't know how many times I've tried to add us.\nThat's a contact type.\nAnd I have never seen that that one show up for me before.\nI don't know why it's so.\nBut that's funny.\nSo yes, you choose contact high facility administrator.\nAnd then we'll say John Stewart.\nAnd then he is active.\nAnd then I click save and finish.\nAnd then there you go.\nThere you go.\nAll right.\nSo.\nSo yeah, so code tables, your drop down menus and your mover boxes.\nIf there's ever a value that's missing, you can go searching for it.\nAgain, like I said, sometimes you might come to a code table and do like a search.\nYou think that yeah, this should be.\nI mean, this is what it should be.\nAnd then you don't see any hits.\nOr any results that this lay.\nIf that's the case, just reach out to our support team and say, hey, I need this value added to this code table.\nAnd I can't seem to find or I need this.\nI need this value added to this drop down menu or this mover box.\nAnd I can't seem to locate the code table for it.\nAnd then they should be able to tell you which code table it is.\nOkay.\nOr maybe you can do it for you.\nBut if they do it for you, I would say could you at least tell me what code table it was that you.\nAbsolutely.\nThat way you know for yourself in the future, right?\nRight.\nYeah.\nBecause I mean, as helpful as support can be, if I know how to do it, then that actually saves me more time.\nBecause now I'm not having to wait on them to give it a ticket and process.\nSomebody else's time.\nYeah.\nThe only other thing with regards to drop down menus and mover boxes, I will tell you is that not.\nNot all of them are controlled by code tables that you have access to.\nAny fields, any any drop down fields or mover box fields on screens that are noted as workspace screens, you don't have access to those code tables.\nOkay.\nSo in those cases, you will need to contact support.\nWhat are the workspace screens?\nStaff member.\nSo let's go back to staff member real quick and then we'll just actually I won't do that.\nWell, let's go into Mr. Stewart's account.\nSee where it says staff member and then workspace.\nIf it ends with workspace on this screen that you're working on, then these fields in it are controlled outside of widths.\nThey're controlled by a different database and are on the back end somewhere.\nOkay.\nSo in that case, you'll need to contact us and say, hey, can we have this added this field or this value added to this field?\nYeah.\nWhich so that's going to be like your staff member workspace.\nAnd any special, actually, I don't think there's any other screens that I can think of that it would affect you.\nThe GIFR is the only other thing that is considered a workspace that you guys work with on a regular basis, but like you guys aren't going to make changes or want to make changes to those fields anyway.\nRight.\nYeah.\nMaster patient index.\nSo underneath system administration, you've got, we'll talk about master patient here in a second, but you've got this far spatch and then the sparse batch errors.\nI don't know that you guys will ever need to worry about going to the sparse batch screen because all it's going to do is just tell you like, it'll show you the batches that have been created.\nIt's completely, it's completely automated.\nSo you guys should never need to create a sparse batch.\nIt'll happen for you automatically.\nAnd if it doesn't, instead of going in and trying manually doing it, I would contact support to find out why it didn't do it automatically.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nSo, but yeah, so the sparse batch screen is just going to show you the batches that have been created to be sent or that have been sent to sparse.\nThe sparse batch error screen is more is more valuable to you because like I said, it's going to show you those different error messages for those rejections from sparse.\nRight.\nBut for you, honestly, the SSRS report on sparse batch errors is going to be better because then you can send that to your agencies to let them know which batches were rejected and why so that they can go and fix it.\nAnd then once it's fixed, it'll get resummeted automatically.\nYeah.\nSo as far as batch errors can be helpful to you, but honestly that report is going to probably be better.\nBecause chances are you're not going to be the one that's going in.\nI mean, I could be wrong. Please let me know if I am, but you're probably not going to be the one that's going into a sparse batch has been rejected and fixing it.\nNo, I don't think I'm fixing it.\nI'll see you.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo like what even though you can see it here and there'll be an option to like access that record, I found I'm mistaken from this screen.\nBut again, you're not going to be fixing it anyway.\nSo accessing, you know, accessing that client record from here isn't going to be any good because you're not, you're not going to be the one that fixes it.\nYou're just going to generate that report, send it to your agencies and then they're going to go and fix it.\nThe only other thing that I can think of is master patient index.\nSo master patient index can be pretty helpful because this is where you can see if a client has been created in multiple agencies.\nBecause like for example, a client can't be can't have an active can't have the same active program enrollment in multiple agencies.\nSo in other words, they can't be enrolled in a SOAR agency or they can't be enrolled in a SOAR program at one agency and then another SOAR program at another agency.\nRight.\nRight.\nSo if you know, and it's out of imagine that this probably happens, you have an agency that calls you and they say, hey, I'm trying to add this client and it's telling me that they already exist in another agency.\nSo here underneath master patient index, you could do a search for that client.\nI'm trying to think if I don't know if we'll even find any.\nOkay, here we go.\nSo like you can do a search for the client and see if they exist in multiple agencies.\nSo like let's pretend for a second that Wade Wilson, that this was Wade Wilson twice.\nIf their date of birth, social security number and name are exactly the same, then you'll notice that they both will have the same unique client number.\nRight.\nSo these two numbers will be the same.\nAnd then you'll see, oh, well, this person already exists and provider in agency provider one and agency service provider one.\nSo then like say they are going to be receiving services and provider one, but they were currently previously enrolled in service provider one.\nSo like in that case, then you might need to like reach out to service provider one to have them, you know, quit the enrollment.\nYeah, yeah, so that they can then be enrolled at the new agency.\nYeah, but this is where you can see if the client has exists in multiple locations.\nRight.\nYeah.\nThe only other thing is that I don't know why, but like I've had some people say, hey, can we talk about like how to prevent duplicate client records or fixing a duplicate client record.\nSo if the client, like I said, if the clients name date of birth and social all match, then they will have the same UCN.\nIf that's not supposed to be the case, if it is two different way to Wilson's, maybe it's Wade Wilson Jr. and Wade Wilson senior.\nThen really the date of birth and social should be different.\nYeah, I'm going to say that's the case.\nWe're going to find a lot more things different.\nYeah, yeah, but for some reason I have had states say, can you explain how to like not make the UCN the unique client number, not be the same.\nIf they haven't, if they haven't open an intake for this for the like the new client record yet.\nIf they change the date of birth or the social, then it'll change the UCN that unique client number.\nRight.\nI'm not quite sure why it would be a thing or necessary, but yeah.\nOkay.\nBut if for some reason, you know, the wrong person's information was given out on accident the first time, then as long as they change that information here or well, as long as they change that information in the client profile before they create that intake, then it'll cause the unique client number to change.\nAnd then they won't show us duplicate client records.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nAnd then it'll even tell them like they'll get a message like this that says that the client should that you've entered already exists in the database.\nYes.\nWish you probably seen that.\nOh, yes, there's definitely various checkpoints.\nYeah.\nAnd that's really it.\nThat was that was the last thing.\nYou know about the new spars process.\nYes, I've heard a little bit about that they're not accepting or which way to put on before I say yes, which new one.\nSo in the past with withs if an agency so like an agency does a Gipra intake on their client and then after that Gipra gets locked and transmitted the spars, the agency gets new information or more information from the client.\nMaybe they didn't maybe the client couldn't answer some of the questions at the time and now they are able to answer them.\nIn the past, the agency could just unlock the Gipra, make those changes, re-lock it and then that Gipra would transmit the spars and update the information and spars automatically.\nRight.\nThe spars is not allowing that anymore spars will reject that new that new or I'm sorry will reject that edit as a duplicate submission.\nSo the Gipra will need to be deleted out of spars before the edited Gipra can be transmitted the spars.\nAll right.\nThe windings.\nYeah.\nAnd that change was made with so or four.\nYeah, okay.\nSo I do remember them saying that was so for started that spars that that was going to be different. I remember that meeting.\nSo you guys you guys at the state level will have I think that's I don't know if that's what the processes that you guys are following, but this is typically what the other states have done is that.\nSo like if I'm watch tower treatment, I need to make I need that Gipra changed.\nThen I contact you at the state level say, Hey, I need this clients Gipra deleted out of spars.\nYou'll submit a ticket to spars to say, Hey, delete that existing Gipra.\nDon't delete it.\nSend you a message back.\nYou'll give that help us ticket number to me at watch tower.\nThen I'll go in or I'm sorry.\nI'm thinking of another state that is doing a different process.\nOnce you get that spars help us ticket number, you'll go into that agency, pull up that client record and unlock the Gipra.\nPut in that part, help us ticket number.\nAnd then you'll let watch tower know, Okay, we've unlocked the Gipra.\nYou can go in and and make your changes and then we submit it.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThat's it.\nAs far as like covering the the woods admin stuff, that's all I can think of that that you need to know.\nBut like here's what I want to say though.\nI'm usually available all the time.\nOkay.\nLike even if I'm working on a project, I can usually find like a little bit of time an hour or so here and there.\nSo if you ever have any questions, just let and know.\nLike especially if there's like if you come across anything and specifically in with that you want to learn more about, just let me know or let and know and she can let me know and just say, hey,\nand I don't care.\nYou can let me know directly or you can let and know and then she can let me know.\nI would just say that make sure that you copy and if you email me directly.\nAnd then just say, hey, can you can you do you have some time to teach me more about this one piece of animation and what's.\nOkay.\nAnd I like as that I can usually find some time somewhere.\nYeah.\nThat works.\nI know Crystal sent she had to get out.\nShe had a family emergency.\nShe said.\nI repeat the PowerPoint.\nSome questions for Scott about about if the provider or ME have access to.\nI'm not the following things.\nI was trying to copy and paste it, but she wants to know if the provider or ME have access to adding a new agency adding a facility to an existing agency.\nNew programs, new users to existing agencies.\nIt's quite a list of things.\nRight.\nAnd my answer to that would be that depends on what roles you're giving them.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nThat depends on what roles.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nTypically the only people that can create new agencies and facilities and that sort of thing are going to be your WITs administrators.\nOkay.\nI have seen and been told those some instances where like maybe you might create the agency and a facility and one one admin account and then the admin goes in and creates a set up like finishes setting up the agency.\nBecause like all you like I said.\nUnder the agency profile the only thing that you need to make sure that you complete are these required fields.\nBut then you could set up an agency administrator.\nSo like you could create someone give them an agency administrator role and then they could come in here and fill out the rest of this.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nSo that's the only word of instances where that is the case.\nBut it's all it all just depends on like what you at the state level decide like how much access you want to give them.\nWe want to give them.\nOkay.\nSo that in that totally depends on us.\nRight.\nRight.\nAnd what we want to allow them to do.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nThat works.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI know that we try to give a which admin basically I did the exact same training with them that I just did with you.\nAnd they were the Emmys were quite upset because they said that none of it applied to what they're currently doing.\nOf course.\nOkay.\nSo then yeah, that's probably why she asked it because then some of them are probably because I know there have been a couple questions about them trying to.\nAre there any other research credentials or do things that wondering why they don't have that access.\nOh, they have to have a role assigned to them.\nYes.\nWhich I think that might have been an email I responded to because if you don't have the access it wasn't assigned to you.\nBut you know, some things are a little more self explanatory to meet into others.\nRight.\nYeah.\nI mean, maybe it's something that you guys do want to give them access to.\nIf you wanted to give your agency administrator like say you have an agency administrators set up for your specific agencies.\nYou could give them all the ability to like reset the credentials.\nAnd then that's something that you won't have to worry about anymore.\nRight.\nRight.\nSo that'll be yeah, that'll be something that I address with Crystal when she returns her so we can figure out maybe how we want to.\nOr if you even want to entertain the idea of giving them a little bit more access.\nRight. Right.\nAnd I mean, if that's something that you want to meet with us on.\nSo like again, just like let me in and though.\nAnd I am more than happy.\nI don't have any problems with this at all.\nSo like sit down with you and Crystal and say, okay.\nWhat do you want them to have access to?\nAnd then we can discuss like what roles would need to be assigned to them.\nI might have like do a little bit like digging around to find the roles, but like we can identify like which roles the people that these users would need to have access to.\nAnd then develop the training to cover the to cover those functions specific to those roles.\nGot it.\nOkay. So I was just sending these to her that way whenever she does come back she has these and then we can we can be in if necessary.\nYeah, absolutely.\nJust let me know.\nYes. This was a lovely two hours.\nI appreciate you for carving out this time.\nNo worries. No worries.\nAnd if you have questions about any of this stuff like I said, don't hesitate to reach out.\nIf I can't answer it, then I'll reach we'll reach out to support together and see if they can't help us out.\nI did that for Alabama yesterday.\nPerfect. Okay. That works.\nAnd then you make this. I know we recorded it.\nYou can just send that to me. You make it available.\nYeah. We'll do.\nAwesome. Thank you very much.\nThank you. Have a good one.\nYou too.\nBye."}],"chatParameters":{"deploymentName":"fldcfopenai-4o-PTU","maxResponseLength":800,"temperature":0.7,"topProbablities":0.95,"stopSequences":[],"pastMessagesToInclude":10,"frequencyPenalty":0,"presencePenalty":0}}
